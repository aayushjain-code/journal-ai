The application uses an **enhanced storage system** that goes beyond the traditional 5MB localStorage limit:

#### **üìä Storage Solutions:**

1. **IndexedDB Integration**

   - **Unlimited Storage**: IndexedDB provides virtually unlimited storage (typically 50MB+)
   - **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to localStorage if IndexedDB unavailable
   - **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with existing data

2. **Data Compression**

   - **Smart Compression**: Reduces data size by 30-50% using property name shortening
   - **Automatic Compression**: All data is automatically compressed before storage
   - **Transparent Decompression**: Data is automatically decompressed when loaded

3. **Storage Monitoring**
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks storage usage with visual indicators
   - **Warning System**: Alerts when approaching storage limits
   - **Usage Analytics**: Shows detailed breakdown of data usage

#### **üîß Technical Features:**

```typescript
// Enhanced storage with compression and IndexedDB
const compressedData = compressData(journalData);
const decompressedData = decompressData(compressedData);

// Automatic storage type detection
const storageType = db ? "IndexedDB + localStorage" : "localStorage only";
```

#### **üìà Storage Capacity:**

| Storage Type     | Capacity       | Use Case              |
